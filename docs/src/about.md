This package was created by Essam Wisam as a Google Summer of Code project on categorical encoding, under the mentorship of Anthony Blaom. Subsequently, the package was expanded to include data transformation methods beyond categorical encoders that were originally developed in MLJModels.jl, originally authored by Anthony Blaom.
